# React
JavaScript library for building interfaces

react uses javascript for logic- it creates something a user can view

react uses the core logic of javascript, with markdown

react: netflix, airbnb, dropbox, etc

Library - collection of code snippets


yarn - package manager, collects node modules and makes them useful

scale/scalable - ability to manage a thing getting bigger

Developer's goals in creating React:
1. Code can be reusable
2. Handles user interactions rapidly and efficiently

## Reusable
Components - classes or functions
  we focus on classes - object oriented approach to programming

## Efficiency
Reacting to the user view
DOM - Document object model (visual representation of code)
    the DOM takes code and makes it into the visual experience
        DOM tree - each point of the tree is a node
        HTML elements/tags are called nodes
React isolates a particular node and only makes changes to that one thing
VDOM - virtual DOM, listens for a diff, isolates the node, and reconciles the diff
