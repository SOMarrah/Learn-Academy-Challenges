# Ruby Introduction

MINASWAN (Matts is nice and so we are nice)

- Dynamic Language - do not have to declare data types when you declare a variable. Dynamically typed- doesnt matter what data type is held by a variable.

- Interpreted - Ruby is read line by line in the program. Translated by the machine.

- Open-source - the entire code base is available to the public for free. can be modified and distributed by anyone.

- Scripting - makes evaluations and executes logical operations. Language for performing logic.

- Object Oriented Programing (OOP) - everything is an instance of a class. Plato's theory of forms - the form is the ideal (perfect version) - in real life it is an object of that thing. A way for us to describe and organize the code

Read Evaluate Print Loop (REPL)
- irb - interactive Ruby
- exit - back to terminal

- integers - numbers
- floats - decimals
- strings - a collection of characters wrapped by single quotes. if a  single quote is needed for punctuation use double quotes.
- boolean - relational operators (<,>, <=,>=), equality operantor (==), logical operators (&&, ||, !=)
- nil -
- assignment operator - (=) everything is in snake_case
- no variable declaration. my_name = 'stephen'
- ruby methods (for the most part) do not change the variable they are used on. Most of the time they are accessors
- arrays - anything that is a valid data type can be used in an array. 0 indexed. you can call the index in reverse by using negative numbers.
